## About

Curatix is a platform that automatically collects content from different sources like blogs, RSS feeds, or social channels, organises it intelligently, and lets users curate or publish their own digest.

This allows users to connect different content sources—like RSS feeds, blogs, or social accounts. The platform automatically fetches new content on a schedule, analyses it to detect topics or tags, stores it, and lets users filter, search, or create curated collections.

## Problem it Solves

Meet **John**, the owner of a tech startup. He has **5,000 subscribers** and needs to create a **weekly tech newsletter** for them.

**The Problem?** 
<p>To stay up to date, he has to go through **20+ tech blogs every day** before publishing an article. This process is time-consuming and has become a major bottleneck.

***Curatix*** solves this problem.

Imagine a personal assistant that reads **1,000 articles daily**, selects the **10 most relevant ones**, organizes them into clear topics, and delivers a **beautiful, concise summary every morning**.

Now imagine this working not just for one person, but for your **entire team**—and instead of just emails, it helps you publish **professional newsletters to thousands of subscribers** effortlessly.
